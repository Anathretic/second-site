# Just-paradise (Website project)

## About

An example of a travel agency website with a well-planned UI that allows to quickly guide a potential customer through the trip booking process.

In addition, the website has a contact form and a booking form which has been planned with great care to make the UX as high as possible.

## Coding & Problems

**This project is an extension of a project from one of the courses.** 

Basic project didn't have:
- Desktop/Mobile Nav,
- Friendly UI - some original solutions caused errors,
- WeatherApp that shows weather on a given island (OOP),
- Booking form **(this is my first self-created form)**,
- And many more, like subpages, notfound page, meta tags etc.

So as you can see, I had to add a lot of new things and functionality to make the site satisfying, so I mastered a lot of things that helped me get into React. 

## Links & Tools
