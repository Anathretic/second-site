# Just-paradise (Website project)

## About

An example of a travel agency website with a well-planned UI that allows to quickly guide a potential customer through the trip booking process.

In addition, the website has a contact form and a booking form which has been planned with great care to make the UX as high as possible.

This project is an extension of a project from one of the courses. 

Basic project didn't have:
- Desktop/Mobile Nav,
- Friendly UI - some original solutions caused errors,
- WeatherApp that shows weather on a given island,
- Booking form,
- And many more, like subpages, notfound page, meta tags etc.

So as you can see, I've been working really hard on this site and I've learned a lot by making these changes.
